The most popular combination? Navy blue lower cabinets with white uppers.\n\n## 2. Quartz Countertops Dominate\nQuartz continues to outpace granite for its durability, low maintenance, and design versatility.\n\n## 3. Smart Kitchen Integration\nWi-Fi-enabled appliances, touchless faucets, and under-cabinet charging stations are now standard in high-end remodels.\n\n## 4. Open Shelving Accents\nWhile full open shelving is declining, accent sections of open shelving mixed with traditional cabinets creates a curated look.\n\n## 5. Oversized Islands\nKitchen islands continue to grow, serving as dining, prep, and social hub all in one.\n\nReady to bring these trends to your Pittsburgh kitchen?

Here's a detailed comparison to help you decide.\n\n## Composite Decking\n\n### Pros\n- Minimal maintenance (no staining/sealing)\n- Won't rot, warp, or splinter\n- 25-year+ warranties\n- Consistent appearance over time\n- Eco-friendly (made from recycled materials)\n\n### Cons\n- Higher upfront cost ($45-85/sq ft installed)\n- Can get hot in direct sun\n- Limited ability to refinish\n- Some options look less natural\n\n### Best Brands\n- Trex (most popular)\n- TimberTech/AZEK\n- Fiberon\n\n## Pressure-Treated Wood\n\n### Pros\n- Lower upfront cost ($25-40/sq ft installed)\n- Natural wood appearance\n- Can be stained any color\n- Easy to repair individual boards\n\n### Cons\n- Requires annual maintenance\n- Will crack, warp, and splinter over time\n- Shorter lifespan (10-15 years)\n- Needs regular staining/sealing\n\n## Our Recommendation\nFor most Pittsburgh homeowners, composite decking is the better long-term investment. The higher upfront cost is offset by virtually zero maintenance over 25+ years.\n\nContact ABK Unlimited for a free deck consultation and quote.",

Here's what every Pittsburgh homeowner should consider before breaking ground.\n\n## Types of Home Additions\n\n### Room Addition (Ground Floor)\nExpand your home's footprint. Ideal when you have available lot space.\n- Average cost: $150-$300/sq ft\n- Timeline: 2-4 months\n\n### Second Story Addition\nBuild up when you can't build out. More complex but preserves yard space.\n- Average cost: $200-$400/sq ft\n- Timeline: 3-6 months\n\n### Sunroom/Four-Season Room\nEnjoy the outdoors year-round. Great for Pittsburgh's variable weather.\n- Average cost: $100-$250/sq ft\n- Timeline: 6-10 weeks\n\n## Key Planning Steps\n1. Check local zoning and setback requirements\n2. Determine if your lot and foundation can support the addition\n3. Match architectural style to existing home\n4. Plan for HVAC extension and electrical upgrades\n5. Get proper permits (ABK handles this)\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Not matching the roofline to existing structure\n- Skimping on foundation work\n- Forgetting about HVAC and electrical capacity\n- Not planning for future resale value\n\nReady to add space to your Pittsburgh home?

      "How much does a new roof cost in Pittsburgh, PA?",
      "In Pittsburgh, a complete roof replacement typically costs between $8,000 and $20,000 for an average-sized home (1,500-2,500 sq ft). Asphalt shingles average $9,500, while architectural shingles run $12,000-$15,000. Metal roofing starts around $15,000. Factors like roof pitch, accessibility, and material choice significantly impact the final price. ABK Unlimited provides free detailed estimates with no obligation.",

    [
      "faq-2",
      "How much should a 2000 sq ft roof cost?",
      "A 2,000 square foot roof in Pittsburgh typically costs $10,000-$16,000 for standard asphalt shingles, including tear-off and disposal. For architectural shingles, expect $13,000-$18,000. Metal roofing for this size runs $18,000-$28,000. These estimates include materials, labor, permits, and cleanup. We recommend getting 3 quotes and choosing based on reputation, not just price.",
      "Roofing"
    ],
    [
      "faq-3",
      "What does a roofer charge per hour in Pittsburgh?",
      "Pittsburgh roofers typically charge $45-$75 per hour for labor, but most residential projects are quoted as flat-rate jobs rather than hourly. A complete roof replacement usually takes 1-3 days with a crew of 4-6 workers. Repair jobs may be charged hourly with a minimum service fee of $150-$300. ABK Unlimited provides transparent flat-rate pricing for all roofing projects.",
      "Roofing"
    ],
    [
      "faq-4",
      "How to spot a bad roofing company?",
      "Red flags include: demanding large upfront payments (legitimate contractors ask for 10-30% deposit), no physical address or PA contractor license, pressure to sign immediately, inability to provide references, no written contract, unusually low bids (often indicates corner-cutting or bait-and-switch), and door-to-door solicitation after storms. Always verify licensing at PA's contractor verification website and check BBB ratings.",
      "Roofing"
    ],
    [
      "faq-5",
      "How long does a roof replacement take?",
      "Most residential roof replacements in Pittsburgh take 1-3 days depending on size, complexity, and weather. A standard 2,000 sq ft roof with a single layer tear-off typically completes in 1-2 days. Larger homes, steep pitches, or multiple layers may take 3-4 days. Metal roofing and specialty materials may require additional time. ABK Unlimited provides specific timelines in every estimate.",

    [
      "faq-6",
      "Does homeowner's insurance cover roof replacement?",
      "Homeowner's insurance typically covers roof damage from sudden events like storms, hail, fallen trees, or fire. Normal wear and aging are not covered. If your roof is damaged, document everything with photos, file a claim promptly, and get a professional inspection. ABK Unlimited works directly with insurance adjusters and can help document damage for your claim.",

      "What is the 30% rule in home renovation?",
      "The 30% rule suggests that the cost of a remodeling project should not exceed 30% of your home's current value. For example, if your home is worth $300,000, you should aim to spend no more than $90,000 on renovations. This helps ensure you don't over-improve for your neighborhood and can recoup your investment when selling.",

      "Yes, $50,000 can accomplish significant renovations depending on your priorities. This budget typically covers a full kitchen OR bathroom remodel, or several smaller updates throughout the home. In Pittsburgh, $50,000 could include a mid-range kitchen renovation ($35,000) plus bathroom updates ($15,000), or a complete basement finishing project.",

In the Pittsburgh market, this can cover a high-end kitchen remodel ($60,000-$75,000) plus a luxury bathroom ($25,000-$35,000), or multiple mid-range projects throughout your home including basement finishing, deck building, and interior updates.",
      "Remodeling"
    ],
    [
      "faq-10",
      "What is a reasonable budget for remodeling?",
      "A reasonable remodeling budget depends on your goals and home value. Most financial experts recommend spending 5-15% of your home's value on renovations. For a $250,000 Pittsburgh home, that's $12,500-$37,500. Kitchens and bathrooms typically offer the best ROI, with basement finishing close behind in our market.",
